# RAMP (test)

## Instructions

Please write a simple React component that does the following:

- The component takes one prop named "input".
- There are three types of input:

1. If the prop is a falsy value, return a live-updating date and time (update every second) in a div.
   Please pretty-format the date and time. Use the native JavaScript Date object.
2. If the prop is an array, return a list of divs, each containing one element of the array.
3. If the prop is anything else, return the value of the prop in a div.
   A functional component using React Hooks is preferred, though not required.
